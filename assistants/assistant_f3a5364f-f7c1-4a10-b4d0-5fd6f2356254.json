However, I can guide you on how to find the latest flight information from LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) to NYC (New York City).\n\nTo get the most up-to-date flight times, I recommend checking with the airlines or online travel agencies like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner. You can also visit the official websites of airports or airlines for schedules.\n\nHere's a tip: If you're looking for flights in the next 24 hours, consider using flight search engines that offer \"today\" or \" tomorrow\" options.\n\nWould you like me to help with something else? \ud83e\udd14",
